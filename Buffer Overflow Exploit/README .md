The goal of this assignment is to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability in a badly written program, the Greeter.
We developed a simple python script, that creates the exploit which forces the Greeter program to spawn a terminal shell.  

## How to build

First of all you have to install the *gcc-multilib* package, in case you do not already have it, which is useful for cross-compiling. 
Run and test the exploit with the appropriate commands:
``` c
$python2 exp.py > exploit
$(cat exploit ; cat) | ./Greeter
$whoami(new terminal)
$ls(new terminal)
```
You need to compile the *exp.py* with Python v2, otherwise it will not be compiled. 

## Implementation
First of all, we used GDB to find the address *0x80dacc0*, which is the address of the global variable Name, and I added it in reverse. After that I found an online shellcode, which is 25-bytes and then I added 23-bytes of NOPs (no operation). 

The code used for the spawn of shell is the one given on the assignment.
